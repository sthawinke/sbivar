---

This repo provides code for performing bivariate association tests between different spatial modalities measured on the same or consecutive slices, possibly with disjoint coordinate sets. A common coordinate framework (CCF) as obtained from alignment is considered given. A simple use-case is shown below, more extensive documentation can be found in the vignette.

<!-- % As introduced in our [preprint](). -->

The package can be installed from GitHub as follows:

```{r installAndLoadGitHub, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("sthawinke/sbivar")
```

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(Biocmanager)
install("sbivar")
```

Once installed, you can load the package

```{r loadsbivar}
library(sbivar)
```
