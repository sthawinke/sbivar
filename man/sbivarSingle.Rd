\arguments{
\item{X, Y}{Matrices of omics measurements}

\item{Cx, Ey}{Corresponding coordinate matrices of dimension two}

\item{method}{A character string, indicating which method to apply}

\item{n_points_grid}{The number of points in the new grid for the GAMs to be
evaluated on.}

\item{mapToFinest}{A boolean, should the one-to-one mapping for modified t-test
occur to the dataset with the best resolution?}

\item{families}{A vector of length 2 giving outcome values.}

\item{gpParams}{Parameters of the Gaussian processes, see details}

\item{Quants}{Most extreme quantiles of the distance distribution to take as lenght scales}

\item{numLscAlts}{Number of length scales to be tested for bivariate association}
}
\value{
A matrix which contains at least a p-values ("pVal") and a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value ("pAdj"),
sorted by increasing p-value.
}
\description{
The tests can be applied to either disjoint or joint coordinate sets.
}
\details{
If only Cx is supplied and X and Y have the same number of rows, a joint analysis is performed
If Cx and Ey are provided, and X and Y have the same number of rows, equality of Cx and Ey is checked.
If true, a joint analysis is run, with a warning.

Any normalization of the data should happen prior to calling this function.
For instance, count data or metabolome data are best scaled to relative values and log-normalized prior to fitting GPs.

gpParams must be a list of length 2 with names 'X' and 'Y', consisting of matrices
with rownames "mean", "nugget", "range" and "sigma", and column names as in X and Y.
This argument allows to pass parameters of the Gaussian processes estimated with other software
to perform the score test.
