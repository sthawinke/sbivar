}
\value{
A matrix which contains at least a p-values ("pVal") and a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value ("pAdj"),
sorted by increasing p-value.
}
\description{
The tests can be applied to either disjoint or joint coordinate sets.
}
\details{
If only Cx is supplied and X and Y have the same number of rows, a joint analysis is performed
If Cx and Ey are provided, and X and Y have the same number of rows, equality of Cx and Ey is checked.
If true, a joint analysis is run, with a warning.

Any normalization of the data should happen prior to calling this function.
For instance, count data or metabolome data are best scaled to relative values and log-normalized prior to fitting GPs.
For GAMs, usually no normalization is needed, as the non-gaussianity is taken care of by
the outcome distribution, offset and link functions. Currently, identity, inverse and log-link are implemented.

gpParams must be a list of length 2 with names 'X' and 'Y', consisting of matrices
with rownames "mean", "nugget", "range" and "sigma", and column names as in X and Y.
This argument allows to pass parameters of the Gaussian processes estimated with other software
to perform the score test.

All methods use multithreading on the cluster provided using the BiocParallel package
